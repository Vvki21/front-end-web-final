                    <p class="text">Your dog’s nose should feel wet. The level of moisture will vary between dogs and by time of year, but a healthy dog will have a cool and slightly wet nose because dogs secrete sweat through their nose to cool down.</p>

                    <p class="text">Brushing your dog’s teeth is often overlooked, but hugely important to their overall health and avoiding expensive dental treatments in the future. Make this a part of their normal routine and make sure to use a toothpaste made specifically for dogs. With a little bit of time and training, teeth brushing can be a fun activity for your pet every day!</p>

                    <h2>Get pet insurance</h2>
                    <p class="text">Emergency and unexpected accidents and illnesses often cost $800 to $1500. With as many as a third of pets needing emergency care per year, this can quickly become a financial burden. Pet insurance can help to cover these unexpected costs, prescription medications, long term health conditions and more, making it an important investment for the furry members of your family.</p>

                    <h2>Exercise together</h2>
                    <p class="text">Race your dog in the park, try dog yoga, climb stairs with your dogs, or take them on an adventurous hike. You’ll both reap the benefits of exercise as you have fun together. Explore the world of dog yoga by practicing "doga." This involves incorporating your dog into your yoga routine, combining stretching and relaxation for both you and your canine companion.
